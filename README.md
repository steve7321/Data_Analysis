# 📘 ADP Data Analysis Modules

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks that cover key topics in the **Advanced Data Analytics (ADP)** curriculum. 
Each notebook is designed as a self-contained module with explanations, code examples, and visualizations.

## 🗂 Overview

| Subject         | Description                                                                |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Preprocessing   | Covers data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature transformation. |
| Sampling        | Introduces sampling methods including random, stratified, and systematic.  |
| Probability     | Explains probability theory fundamentals and distributions.                |
| Estimation      | Demonstrates point and interval estimation techniques.                     |
